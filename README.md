# IPL 2024 Data Analytics Project

This project focuses on analyzing IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating various visualizations to extract insights from the data.

## Overview

The IPL dataset for the year 2024 was used for this project. It includes information such as match details, teams, toss decisions, match outcomes, and player performances. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation** : The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, convert data types, and ensure consistency.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  Various analyses and visualizations were performed to extract insights such as the matches won by each team, player performance trends, and more.
